	/**
	 *	THE ACTIVATION FAILED PAGE
	 *
	 *	This view contains the information show to a user whos activation failed. The controller
	 *	will look for an app version of the file first and load that up. It will fall back
	 *	to the empty Nails view if not available (which includes some basic styling so as not
	 *	to look totally rubbish).
	 *
	 *	You can completely overload this view by creating a view at:
	 *
	 *	application/views/auth/activate/fail
	 *
